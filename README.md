Iâ€™m Suhaib, an aspiring Computer Scientist currently studying at Heriot-Watt University Malaysia. I am incredibly passionate about programming, having experience in several programming languages and concepts such as C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite and more.

Alongside my studies, I take on project management roles, whether at school, in extracurricular clubs, or in past work experiences. I focus on keeping a positive growth mindset and making the most out of the opportunities at hand.

Although I still have a long way to go, Iâ€™m happy to share what I know and contribute wherever I can.
